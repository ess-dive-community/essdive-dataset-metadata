# ESS-DIVE dataset metadata reporting format v1.0.0

## About the reporting format
The ESS-DIVE dataset metadata reporting format ensures that all datasets submitted to the [ESS-DIVE data repository](https://ess-dive.lbl.gov/) have consistent and complete metadata. More complete metadata can enable data discovery and data resue. When creating the reporting format, the ESS-DIVE team reviewied existing metadata schema including [JSON-LD](https://json-ld.org/) and [Ecological Metadata Language](https://eml.ecoinformatics.org/). By ensuring that the resulting ESS-DIVE metadata reporitng format aligned as much as possible with existing schema and other resources, this enables our reporitng format to interoperate with other data modeling languages and data repositories.

When ESS-DIVE's user community [submits data to the repository](https://data.ess-dive.lbl.gov/submit), they will be asked to fill out metadata for their entire dataset. Users can enter this metadata through our point-and-click [web form](https://docs.ess-dive.lbl.gov/contributing-data/data-submission-guidelines/complete-guide) or [programatically via our API](https://docs.ess-dive.lbl.gov/contributing-data/data-submission-guidelines/package-service-tutorial).  Because the previously mentioned links include step-by-step guidance on how to submit data, in this GitHub repository we share documents that explain our metadata schema and development process.
